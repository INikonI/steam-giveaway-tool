#### üîÑ How to Use the Giveaway Tool

1. **Launch the App**: Open the Steam Giveaway Tool from your desktop or terminal.

- Choose the number of winners you want to select
- To track users who have already won, you can press `Save current`, and later in the filters, you can exclude these users
  - there is also an option for auto-saving, but if you perform test/randomizations by accident, it may count users as already winning, even if they haven't. Therefore, it‚Äôs better to use manual saving
